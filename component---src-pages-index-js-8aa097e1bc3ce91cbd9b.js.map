I think long-term and build\n          strong foundations that are resilient to change. I have extensive\n          experience with Figma and helped build out an entire design system\n          from scratch, and strongly support the use of atomic design\n          principles. Working with design systems has taught me to always think\n          of a scalable solution, not just the quickest or easiest.{\" \"}\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I also do a bit of coding, which I studied in college and have used in\n          each of my roles over the years.. but I prefer to keep that as\n          my secret weapon.{\" \"}\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default IndexPage;\n\nexport const Head = () => <title>Brendan Nofs Portfolio</title>;\n"],"names":["IndexPage","React","Layout","className","Head"],"sourceRoot":""}
